DESCRIPTION:
This is the GO/goroutine implementation of Timed Failure

FILES: 
Server.go
Client.go
README (this!)


USAGE:
1. Run the server first and then one or more clients from the same design set (eg. thickServer and one or more instances of thinClient)
2. Pass no commandline arguments for client if both server and client are running on same system. Pass server IP as commandline argument when running client from different machine.

TEST:
If response from server is delayed, no response will be printed.
