DESCRIPTION:
This is the GO/goroutine implementation of Mutual Exclusive Locks (Mutex)
discussed in the Tuesday's (9/29/2015) lecture. A masterdata is maintained
and any read/write thread accessing it will acquire a lock and release once
read/write operation is completed. GO has inbuilt Mutex lock feature
which makes this implementation fairly straightforward
