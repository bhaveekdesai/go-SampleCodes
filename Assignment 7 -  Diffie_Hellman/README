DESCRIPTION:
This is the GO/goroutine implementation of Diffie-Hellman discussed in
Thursday's (10/22/2015) lecture

FILES: 
Alice.go
Bob.go
README (this!)


USAGE:
1. Run Alice
2. Run Bob in a separate terminal
3. Enter private key for Bob
4. Switch to Alice's terminal and enter private key for Alice
5. Observe the shared secret key displayed on respective terminals which
are calculated by them locally

TEST:
Based on the private keys, public keys are calculated exchanged. Once
public keys are received, shared secret key is calculated locally. This
has to be same for both - Alice & Bob.
